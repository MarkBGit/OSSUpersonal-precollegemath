# Summary

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in pre-college math** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in fundamental concepts
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

The courses are specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**:
- Be open for enrollment
- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles
- Match the [curricular standards](CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md)

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some extra courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US) and [edX](https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/) offer financial aid.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups. Each course has a prerequisite of the previous course, so they should be done in a linear order top to bottom.

**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
*Respect the code of conduct* that you signed in the beginning of each course!

# Curriculum

Many OSSU students choose to review math topics that they have not studied recently.
OSSU recommends to use a few resources for such a review: [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard/playlists) for lectures, [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) for textbooks, and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) for assesments.
After taking an assessment, you should have a clear idea of what topics to study and where you should start with the resources below.

Courses | Lectures | Textbooks | Tutoring & Assessments
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Prealgebra | [Prealgebra](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C9296DF81B9EF13) | [OpenStax Prealgebra 2e](https://openstax.org/books/prealgebra-2e/pages/1-introduction) ([PDF](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/Prealgebra2e-WEB_0qbw93r.pdf)) | [Prealgebra Course Challenge](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/test/xb4832e56:course-challenge)
Algebra 1 | [To The Point Math](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDesaqWTN6ETc1ZwHWijCBcZ2gOvS2tTN) | [OpenStax Elementary Algebra 2e](https://openstax.org/books/elementary-algebra-2e/pages/1-introduction) ([PDF](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/ElementaryAlgebra2e-WEB_3zxfu3Z.pdf)) | [Algebra 1 Course Challenge](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/test/x2f8bb11595b61c86:course-challenge)
Algebra 2 | [Intermediate Algebra](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC292123722B1B450) | [OpenStax Intermedia Algebra 2e](https://openstax.org/books/intermediate-algebra-2e/pages/1-introduction) ([PDF](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/IntermediateAlgebra2e-WEB_RlpFLLx.pdf)) | [Algebra 2 Course Challenge](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/test/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:course-challenge)
Precalculus | [Precalculus - College Algebra/Trigonometry](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP) | [OpenStax Precalulus 2e](https://openstax.org/books/precalculus-2e/pages/1-introduction-to-functions) ([PDF](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/Precalculus_2e-WEB.pdf)) | [Precalculus Course Challenge](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/test/x9e81a4f98389efdf:course-challenge)

When watching the lectures it is important that you pause before each question and work it out yourself, or try again after you understand the process.
After you complete a chapters worth of lectures, you should complete the [chapter review exercises](https://openstax.org/books/precalculus-2e/pages/1-review-exercises) found at the end of each chapter in your textbook.
Use your grade to determine what you need to review. OpenStax orders their review exercises by chapter section, allowing you to hone in on what you need to practice.
Practice what you have not mastered by:
1. Going to the proper section in your textbook and working on the examples as they have full answer explanations.
2. Rewatching Professor Leonard's video on the subject, working through the examples with him.
3. Searching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) for another POV on the topic, again working through the examples with them. [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@khanacademy) & [Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor) are great resources for this.
4. Doing the section exercises in your textbook.
5. Asking for help in the relevant [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/744385009028431943/744971809056751687).

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you will have completed all the prerequisite math for a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
Congratulations!

What is next for you? You can start with the OSSU [Computer Science](https://cs.ossu.dev) or [Data Science](https://ds.ossu.dev) curriculum.

## How to show your progress

[Fork](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fork-a-github-repository/) the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossu/precollege-math) into your own GitHub account and put âœ… next to the stuff you've completed as you complete it. This can serve as your [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) and will be faster to implement than any other solution (giving you time to spend on the courses).
